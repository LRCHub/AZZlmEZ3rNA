```lrc
[00:09.17] Got me caught in the night like a fire in July
[00:13.81] Like a fist with no fight, got nobody on my side
[00:18.52] And I do it alone
[00:21.04] Right on the cup, right on the edge
[00:23.44] I do it alone
[00:25.81] Wherever I go, wherever I go
[00:29.15] Come on, let me take you where the water ends
[00:33.68] Lose your mind and let your body fall again
[00:38.63] Push you to the limit where you've never been
[00:42.86] And if you feel like getting lost tonight
[00:46.45] I'll take you where the water ends
[00:56.29] I'll take you where the water ends
[01:02.32] And if you feel like getting lost tonight
[01:06.06] I'll take you where the water ends
[01:21.77] And if you feel like getting lost tonight
[01:25.35] I'll take you where the water ends
[01:29.06] You've been stuck in this life, don't know where you gonna hide
[01:33.90] Like a storm through the night, got nobody on your side
[01:38.57] So you do it alone
[01:40.83] You're right on the cup, right on the edge
[01:43.40] Do it alone
[01:45.87] Wherever you go, wherever you go
[01:48.95] Come on, let me take you where the water ends
[01:53.82] Lose your mind and let your body fall again
[01:58.50] Push you to the limit where you've never been
[02:02.95] And if you feel like getting lost tonight
[02:06.51] I'll take you where the water ends
[02:16.27] I'll take you where the water ends
[02:22.41] And if you feel like getting lost tonight
[02:25.96] I'll take you where the water ends
[02:41.88] And if you feel like getting lost tonight
[02:45.29] I'll take you where the water ends
